= Introduction

KNISTR’s software architecture centers around decoupled microservices
that provide functionality via RESTful APIs with a JSON payload. All these services are part of our ONEFRAMEWORK architecture. We work with multiple Squads on our product and the Squads are the domain expert for their services. Other Squads but also external service integrator uses these APIs to build their solutions. It becomes a key success factor to provide smart APIs to make integration easy and fast.

With this in mind, we’ve adopted "API First" as one of our key engineering principles.
Microservices development begins with API
definition outside the code and ideally involves ample peer-review
feedback to achieve high-quality APIs. API First encompasses a set of
quality-related standards and fosters a peer review culture including a
lightweight review procedure. We encourage our teams to follow them to
ensure that our APIs:

* are easy to understand and learn
* are general and abstracted from specific implementation and use cases
* are robust and easy to use
* have a common look and feel
* follow a consistent RESTful style and syntax
* are consistent with other teams’ APIs and our global architecture

Ideally, all our APIs will look like the same author created them.

The purpose of our "RESTful API guidelines" is to define standards to
successfully establish "consistent API look and feel" quality. The
{api-guild}[architecture guild]
drafted and owns this document. Teams are responsible to fulfill
these guidelines during API development and are encouraged to contribute
to guideline evolution via pull requests.

These guidelines will, to some extent, remain work in progress as our
work evolves, but teams can confidently follow and trust them.

In case guidelines are changing, following rules apply:

* existing APIs don't have to be changed, but we recommend it
* clients of existing APIs have to cope with these APIs based on
outdated rules
* new APIs have to respect the current guidelines

Furthermore you should keep in mind that once an API becomes public
externally available, it has to be re-reviewed and changed according to
current guidelines - for sake of overall consistency.
